# PopularMoviesApp
Displays top or pouplar movies

This app connects to https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en to get the top or poular movies. 
It gets the poster, title, year it was released in, rating and movie plot. 

The main screen displays the movie poster and clicking on a movie poster will launch a detail
activity which will display more information about the movie.

I have removed my API Key from gradle.build(Module:app). In order to succesfully run this app, register on 
https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en and get the API key.
